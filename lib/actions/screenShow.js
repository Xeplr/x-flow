// screen-show — PARK THE RUN AND LET A PERSON FILL IN A SCREEN.
//
// The step behind every node of a 'screens' flow (see lib/flows.js). It is a
// `wait` step whose action does nothing at all, and the nothing is the whole
// design:
//
//   1. the engine mints the resume key BEFORE the action runs (see
//      workflowRunner's executeFrom) and parks the run at status 'waiting';
//   2. this returns immediately, so there is nothing to undo and nothing that
//      can fail between "the person opened the screen" and "the run is
//      waiting for them";
//   3. the person submits; POST /flows/runs/:runId/submit resumes the step
//      with what they typed, and resumeByKey MERGES that onto this output.
//
// ── why it returns {} and not { screen } ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The step's output IS the submitted values, and nothing else. Transitions on
// a screens flow read `output.<field>` where <field> is a field of the screen,
// so anything this action put in the output would occupy a name a screen might
// legitimately use — a screen with a field called `screen` would then branch on
// this action's own bookkeeping until the moment it was submitted.
//
// Which screen was shown is not lost by returning nothing: the resolved input
// is persisted on the step run (workflow_step_runs.input), so history records
// it, and the facade reads the screen off the STEP row (values.screen) rather
// than off a run, because that is where the flow's design lives.
//
// ── why it is not in the action palette ──────────────────────────────────
//
// It is registered (the engine resolves a step's actionName through the
// registry, so a step could not run without it) but hidden from GET /actions —
// see lib/actionCatalog.js's HIDDEN. Dropping one onto the ordinary workflow
// canvas would produce a step that parks forever: nothing outside the flows
// facade knows how to show a screen or how to resume it.
