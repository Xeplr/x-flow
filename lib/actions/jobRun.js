// job-run — START A JOB AND PARK UNTIL IT REPORTS BACK.
//
// The step behind an arrow on the "connect jobs" canvas. Everything it does is
// two HTTP calls' worth of glue between two products that do not import each
// other:
//
//   1. POST <jobsUrl>/jobs/<jobId>/trigger  { inputs, callbackUrl }
//   2. return — the STEP does not finish here. It is a `wait` step, so the run
//      parks, and @xeplr/jobs POSTs the outcome to callbackUrl when the
//      occurrence reaches a terminal state, which resumes it.
//
// ── why it does not wait for the job ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// A movement runs for twenty minutes. Holding an await open across that would
// tie a run's progress to one process staying alive, and a deploy in the
// middle would lose it with nothing recording why. The resume key is a row in
// a table: it survives a restart, and it is the same mechanism an emailed
// approval link has always used.
//
// ── THIS IS TEMPORARY, AND SHOULD BE DELETED ─────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing here is about jobs except the URL shape and the field named
// `callbackUrl`. The general form is @xeplr/actions' `http-request` (today a
// placeholder) called from a wait step with `{resumeUrl}` bound into its body,
// which would serve jobs, saved API calls and anything else that can honour
// the callback contract. This exists so the jobs canvas can be finished
// first; when http-request lands, a job step becomes a configuration of it and
// this file goes away.
//
// It lives in xeplr-workflow rather than in @xeplr/actions deliberately: it is
// glue between two products, and putting it in the shared action library would
// teach that library what a job is.
