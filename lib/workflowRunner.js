// workflow_run_edges.sql) that this same engine drives independently.
//
// TENANT CONTEXT: every DB touch after the very first lookup runs inside
// runWithMt(mtOf(row), ...) using the RUN's own stored mtIds — never the
// caller's ambient context. A run can resume long after the request that
// started it has ended (a resume click days later, a fanned-out child
// finishing on its own), so there may be no ambient context at all — see

/**
 * A RESUME CAN BE A FAILURE.
 *
 * `opts.status === 'failed'` resolves the parked step as failed instead of
 * succeeded, and from there the step's ordinary `onError` decides what
 * happens — 'stop' (the default) fails the run, 'continue' moves on by
 * position. No new concept: it is the same treatment a step gets when its own
 * action fails, arriving down a different road.
 *
 * This is what a job chain needs. A workflow step that starts a twenty-minute
 * movement parks on its key; the job fails, times out, or is refused because
 * the job was already running; and without this the step would resolve as
 * SUCCESSFUL carrying a failure in its output. The next step would then run
 * against data that was never moved — an aggregation over a period nothing
 * loaded, a deletion of rows that were never replaced. Silently, because
 * every status on the screen would read green.
 *
 * The caller says which it is, because only the caller knows. @xeplr/jobs
 * decides that 'skipped', 'timedOut' and 'interrupted' all mean "the work did
 * not happen" and sends `status: 'failed'`; this engine never learns jobs'
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * OPTIONAL, and absent means success — every existing caller (an approval
 * click, a confirmation link) resolves a step that succeeded, and none of
 * them should have to start saying so.
